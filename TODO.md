## Ristrictions due to time
- Could not test rate changes every 3s 
- Flow is not organized, could've separate it in clearer methods
- Some properties could've been managed better between the flow and the template
- Used bootstrap without great attention to UI
- Manage when input is empty, and we switch currency, it keeps saving values (a bug)
- Add switch for forced rate, and disable/enable input (instead i mixed it and used a small text)
- I did not manage git flow, i just pushed to main without clear steps through commits
